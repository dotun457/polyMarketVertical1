# Prediction Router

**Narrative Intelligence  
powered by Prediction Data  
feeding AI Agents.**

Prediction Router is a multi-layer prediction intelligence platform.  
We aggregate markets, sentiment, and news into structured **Narratives**,  
and build the foundation for future **AI market copilots**.

This repo contains:

- The **web app** (Next.js)
- The **API backend** (Node + TypeScript)
- Vertical and horizontal architecture docs
- Development roadmap and milestones

## Core Vertical Order
We build in the following sequence:

1. **V0 – Analytics Core (Polysights Clone)**
2. **V2 – Truth Feed (News → Market Impact)**
3. **V1 – Sentiment Layer (Truth Tokens)**
4. **V3 – Localization Engine (Geo-belief)**
5. **V5 – Narrative Intelligence (Narrative Graph)**

V4 (Exchange Layer) is future/compliance-dependent.

Agent should ignore !!!!

✔ FINAL ANSWER (short)

Yes — create a focused set of markdown docs so any new chat, agent, or collaborator instantly understands the architecture.

Below is the exact doc list you need:

Essentials:

README.md

verticals-overview.md

horizontals-overview.md

development-roadmap.md

milestones.md

One folder per vertical (overview + dev-plan)

verticals/v0/...

verticals/v2/...

verticals/v1/...

verticals/v3/...

verticals/v5/...

Backend tech docs

backend/api-contracts.md

backend/db-schema.md

backend/jobs.md

Agent foundation

agents/agent-layer-overview.md

agents/system-prompts.md

# PolyMarket Verticals — Final Canonical Architecture

This document defines the **master vertical architecture** for the PolyMarket-driven
Narrative Intelligence ecosystem.

**IMPORTANT:**  
👉 The vertical numbering **is identical** to the **build order**.  
👉 No more “conceptual vs implementation” mismatch.

This is the **one true, final structure** for all future work.

# 🔥 Final Canonical Vertical Order (Labels = Build Order)

| Vertical | Name | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **V1** | **Truth Feed** | News → Markets engine. Makes app feel alive. |
| **V2** | **Sentiment Layer** | Truth Tokens + Polls. User-driven market signals. |
| **V3** | **Localization Engine** | Regional divergence + personalized feeds. |
| **V4** | **Exchange Layer** | Future matching engine (dormant). |
| **V5** | **Narrative Intelligence** | Narrative graph + composite probabilities. |
| **V6** | **Narrative Agents** | Agents powered by narrative graphs. |

# 🎯 Why This Order?

## **V1 → The App Comes Alive**
Truth Feed continuously streams:
- headlines  
- market mappings  
- impact scores  

The app works even with **0 users**.

## **V2 → Add User-Driven Signals**
Once the world signals exist (V1), add:
- Truth Token polls  
- user sentiment  
- voting-based probabilities  

## **V3 → Personalize the World**
After sentiment + news + markets exist, enable:
- regional feeds  
- divergence detection  
- local preference modeling  

## **V4 → Leave the Exchange Dormant (For Now)**
We won’t build matching engines or orderbooks until compliance is clear.

## **V5 → Combine It All into a Narrative Graph**
Narratives = markets + news + sentiment + region data.

## **V6 → Bring Narratives to Life with Agents**
Agents can:
- “speak” as narratives  
- analyze narrative movement  
- give real-time commentary  
- guide users through market reasoning
